There are a few things that could greatly enhance this script so that it can be used in future analysis.
  1. Develop a larger and more structed list of variables that can be used for different types of elections and for answering different questions within the voting data of said election. Depending on the data these variables could be predefined to grab voter demographic information, candidate campaign impact, when citizens voted, etc. The more structured the variables list is the easier it is to gather the desired data. For example, if the data included total eligible voters we could find the amount of votes cast as a percentage of total eligible voters.
  2. The for loops and the print functions could be organized better to have a clearer view of the what the code is doing.
